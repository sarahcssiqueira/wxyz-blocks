## Custom block category

By default, the WordPress core provides some categories which you can assign to your Gutenberg blocks. However, to keep things organized, can be a good idea to create custom block categories for categorizing your plugin, categorize your blocks based on some features, etc.

To achieve that, you can create your custom block category using the WordPress block filter `block_categories_all`.

Example: **register_new_category** function:

```
//index.php

       function register_new_category ($categories) {
            $categories[] = array(
                'slug'  => 'custom-category',
                'title' => 'Custom Category'
            );

            return $categories;
        }

        add_filter( 'block_categories_all' , 'register_new_category');

```
